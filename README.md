## Quick Start — Try Smack.sh in ~60s ⚡

1) Clone, install, and start the Remix dev server:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smack-sh/smack-sh.git
cd smack-sh
pnpm install        # or npm install / yarn
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local for any required keys
pnpm run dev        # run the app (web + integrated services)
```

2) Run Electron (desktop) in parallel (recommended during development):
```bash
pnpm run electron:dev
```

3) Build & package for production:
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run package:electron
```

4) Quick Docker (example):
```bash
# Example build
pnpm run dockerbuild

# Example run
pnpm run dockerrun
```

Tip: If you prefer a one-liner to start the web dev server:
```bash
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

## Feature — We are working to add (in progress / planned) 🔁
We keep an active backlog. Below are items called out in the original README (kept as-is, but clarified):

- [ ] desktop app fullstack development  
- [ ] flutter and react native support  
- [ ] making a custom web view and a real mobile view for flutter and desktop without the need of webcontainers to be more flexible with our own needs  
- [ ] Switching to Tauri from Electron for better performance on our desktop version that is in internal beta  
- [ ] Working on a CLI  
- [ ] Working on an IDE (not the previously listed smack-ide which is no longer maintained) that we will start maintaining again  
- [ ] Working on an adblocker that is based on uBlock Origin but upgraded with AI to warn you before going to a dangerous website

If you want a specific feature prioritized, please open an issue describing your use case and impact.
